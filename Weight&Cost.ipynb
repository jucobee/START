    "For all of the concepts we developed, we used the same criterion for calculating the weight of the crew and the payload. Each crew is made up of 2 pilots and 1 attendant, each weighing approximately 190lbs and carrying 30lbs of baggage each. The payload includes 50 passengers, each weighing about 200lbs and carrying 40lbs of baggage each. These values came from the AIAA requirements for the aircraft design. Both the cruise speed, 350 knots, and the mission range of 1000 nmi were also taken from the AIAA requirements are the same for all the concepts. We chose a cruising altitude of 25000 ft as many similar aircraft such as the Dash 8 and the Dornier 328 cruise at that altitude [3]. Based on the Dash-8 we found a rate of climb of 1800 ft/min [8]. For propeller efficiency, a value between around 0.7 and 0.8 [2]. This value can be altered depending on the engine being used. The lift to drag ration (L/D) changes depending on the aircraft concept you are estimating the weight of. Comparable aircraft had values around 15 to 18 [4]. The endurace value is also subject to change depending on the mission profile. We settled on any value between 30 to 60 minutes for a given mission. For power specific fuel consumption, we found for the Dash 8 a PSFC of 0.483 and an efficiency of 0.311 [6]. We made an assumption that our aircraft would likely be fueled with A-1 jet fuel, which we found to have an energy density of 43.15 MJ/kg [1]. Additionally we predicted based on some projections that it would be possible for a battery density of 500 Wh/kg by 2035 [7]."

    "For our weight estimation, we developed a \"hybridization\" factor that would allow us to control how much energy of each stage of the mission is used by the electric system. We called this term beta, and we have a unique beta value for each stage that we can control. The thought process was to calculate the amount of energy needed for a given stage. Then we apply our beta value to see how much of that energy needs to come from fuel and from the battery. Once we have those values, we can use specific energies of the fuel and batteries and energy density to calculate the mass of fuel or batteries needed to achieve the needed amount of energy. For this mission profile, we are assuming that beta will be 0.5 for takeoff and climb, and 0 for all other stages of the flight.

    "# COST ESTIMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding the approximate cost of our concepts, we started with a set of criterion that we applied to all of them. We chose a cruise velocity of 350 knots as per the AIAA RFP. We decided that it was reasonable for our company to make 100 aircraft in 5 years with 5 prototypes for testing, which equates to about 1.75 aircraft per month. The number of propellers, electric motors, and combustion engines all depended on the concept we were working with. We used the given CPI of 1.31 from the lecture slides in class. We decided for our cost estimation to use the Dash-8 engine as a basis for the engine specs we needed to enter. We found a shaft horse power of about 2500hp, which we split evenly between the electric and combustion motors [6]. Additionally, we decided to make a guess that by 2035 it would be possible for our plane to have a battery capacity of 1500 kWh. Basing our propeller off the Dash 8, it has a propeller diameter of 13.45 ft [5]."
